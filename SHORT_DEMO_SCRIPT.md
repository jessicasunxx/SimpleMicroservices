*"This is the automatically generated OpenAPI documentation. I have 15 endpoints including complete CRUD operations for both Person and Address resources - POST to create, GET to list, GET with ID to retrieve, PUT to replace, PATCH for partial updates, and DELETE to remove."*

### **3. Test the API (3-4 minutes)**
**What to do:** Run `./demo_commands.sh`
**What to say:**
*"Let me demonstrate with real data. I'll create a person and address, then show the CRUD operations."*

**While script runs, point out:**
- *"Creating a person with Columbia UNI validation"*
- *"Creating an address with UUID generation"*
- *"Listing all data"*
- *"Updating with PATCH for partial changes"*
- *"Replacing with PUT for full updates"*
- *"Deleting resources"*
